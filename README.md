Multilateral, asynchronous, bidirectional synchronization

Here's the primary Feature Injection User Story:

In order to be able to create/edit/delete pages and files on any clone<br>
As a user<br>
I want to be sure that when I synchronize my clone with any other clone, pages and files histories
are merged and multilaterally edited pages and files are tagged for manual review and approval.
