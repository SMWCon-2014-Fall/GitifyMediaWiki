Multilateral, asynchronous, bidirectional synchronization 

In order to be able to create/edit/delete pages and files on any clone
As a user 
I want to be sure that when I synchronize my clone with any other clone, pages and files histories
are merged and multilaterally edited pages and files are tagged for manual review and approval.
